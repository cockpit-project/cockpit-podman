Comment:
 This does not directly cover the files in dist/*. These are "minified" and
 compressed JavaScript/HTML files built from src/, lib/, po/, and node_modules/
 with node, npm, and a bundler. node_modules/ is not shipped as part of the
 upstream release tarballs, but can be reconstructed precisely through the
 shipped package-lock.json with the command "npm install".  Rebuilding files in
 dist/ requires internet access as that process needs to download additional
 npm modules from the Internet, thus upstream ships the pre-minified bundles
 as part of the upstream release tarball so that the package can be built
 without internet access and lots of extra unpackaged build dependencies.
