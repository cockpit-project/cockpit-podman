# This is a script run to release welder-web through Cockpituous:

# Anything that start with 'job' may run in a way that it SIGSTOP's
# itself when preliminary preparition and then gets a SIGCONT in
# order to complete its work.

# Check cockpituous documentation for available release targets.

# Once you have a Fedora package and add the https://pagure.io/user/cockpit
# user to your project's maintainers, you can also upload to Fedora automatically:

## Authenticate for pushing into Fedora dist-git (works in Cockpituous release container)
# cat ~/.fedora-password | kinit cockpit@FEDORAPROJECT.ORG
## Do fedora builds for the tag, using tarball
# job release-koji -k master
# job release-koji f29
# job release-bodhi F29

# These are likely the first of your release targets; but run them after Fedora uploads,
# so that failures there will fail the release early, before publishing on GitHub

# job release-github
# job release-copr @myorg/myrepo
